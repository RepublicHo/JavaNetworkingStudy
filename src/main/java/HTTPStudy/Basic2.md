Many websites use small strings of text known as
cookies to store persistent client-side state between
connections. **Cookies are passed from server to client 
and back again in the HTTP headers of requests and responses.**

Cookies can be used by a server to indicate sessions IDs,
shopping cart contents, login credentials, and more.

which identifies a particular record in a database of some kind
where the real information is kept.
